Hello there,

I'm just testing the "sublimegit" (evrything in ST is supposed to be sublime, no kidding), I'm not sure it's so much full featured as they said. besides it's not even free, neither is ST btw. Fortunately, ther is always p2p to help in such cases...
returning to git, I can seem to find a way to connect with an existing project. The tutorial I'm following - at https://docs.sublimegit.net/tutorial.html - is about setting up a django project. very fashionable, but not really what i'd call a "quickstart". wait and see..
wait a minute: now windows is desperately wanting to reqtart after another of these so "critical" upgrades. If only it could prevent another system error like the one I recently had just after closing the "postman" packaged app (I have a bug analysis report on this for details). Let it wait, WTF!. To say the truth, I enjoy typing in ST, maybe because of the nice coffee background.
let's return to git. I've created a new, special, "test" folder just for this plugin. It's (almost) emty for the moment. The current file will be the habitual "readme.md". Oh, yes, plain text is dead, now we MUST use some sort of "markdown" or "restructured" downgraded html.
